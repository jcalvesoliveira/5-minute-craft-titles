Data mine video titles of the popular YouTube channel, “5-Minute Crafts,” to gain insights on the impact of word choice on the number of views and analyze effectiveness of clickbait key words and topics on video popularity.

The continuing shift in consumer behavior moving from traditional media to new media for entertainment has resulted in more marketing and advertising dollars spent on digital content platforms such as YouTube. To maximize earning potential, a content creator must be focused on increasing metrics such as number of views and subscribers for their channel. There are many strategies that exist to capture an audience including posting on multiple social platforms, targeted subject matter, producing universal shareable/viral content, user interaction, and selection of genre whether news/opinion, educational, or storytelling.  

This study will analyze the titles of the successful YouTube channel, “5-Minute Crafts,” to gain insights on the impact of word choice on the number of views and analyze effectiveness of clickbait key words and topics on video popularity. Without including YouTube’s managed channels, “5-Minute Crafts” is the 11th most subscribed to channel with almost 75 million subscribers as of December 2021.
